# GameDev-4

### Details 

Version Unity : 2021.3.18f1

The Changes in the game that I made:

* The shield is not on the screen at the beginning, but appears from time to time at a random point. When the player collides with the shield, added
A circle around the player's spaceship. The color of the circle fades second by second until it disappears after 5 seconds.

* The player cannot shoot lasers without a break, but must wait a certain time (let's say half a second) between shots
For the next shot.

* The enemies rotate around themselves at different speeds trying to hit the player.

* Changing the background, the space animation, changing the design of the enemies.
